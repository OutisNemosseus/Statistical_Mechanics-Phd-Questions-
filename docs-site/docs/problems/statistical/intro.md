# Part II: Statistical Physics

## Overview

Statistical physics provides the microscopic foundation for thermodynamics. This section covers problems related to:

- Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
- Ensemble theory (microcanonical, canonical, grand canonical)
- Quantum statistics (Fermi-Dirac, Bose-Einstein)
- Applications to physical systems

## Key Concepts

### Fundamental Postulate

All accessible microstates of an isolated system are equally probable.

### Boltzmann Distribution

The probability of a system being in state $i$ with energy $E_i$:

$$
P_i = \frac{e^{-E_i/k_BT}}{Z}
$$

Where the partition function is:
$$
Z = \sum_i e^{-E_i/k_BT}
$$

### Connection to Thermodynamics

| Quantity | Statistical Expression |
|----------|----------------------|
| Free energy | $F = -k_BT \ln Z$ |
| Internal energy | $U = -\frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta}$ |
| Entropy | $S = k_B \ln \Omega = k_B(\ln Z + \beta U)$ |
| Pressure | $P = k_BT \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial V}$ |
