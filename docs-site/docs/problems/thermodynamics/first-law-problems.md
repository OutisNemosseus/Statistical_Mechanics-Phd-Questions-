Problems 1001-1030 cover thermodynamic states and the first law.

## Problem Distribution

| Problem Range | Topic | Difficulty |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| 1001-1005 | Temperature measurement | Basic |
| 1006-1012 | Heat capacity | Intermediate |
| 1013-1020 | Ideal gas processes | Intermediate |
| 1021-1025 | Adiabatic processes | Advanced |
| 1026-1030 | Radiation | Advanced |

## Sample Problems

### Problem 1001: Temperature Scales
A thermometer reads 50°C. Convert this to:
- (a) Fahrenheit
- (b) Kelvin
- (c) Rankine

**Key equations:**
$$T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32$$
$$T_K = T_C + 273.15$$

### Problem 1010: Heat Capacity of Gases
Calculate the molar heat capacity at constant volume for:
- (a) Helium (monatomic)
- (b) Nitrogen (diatomic)
- (c) Carbon dioxide (linear triatomic)

**Approach:** Use equipartition theorem with $C_V = \frac{f}{2}R$

---

### Problem 1015: Isothermal Expansion
One mole of an ideal gas at 300 K expands isothermally from 10 L to 20 L. Calculate:
- (a) Work done by the gas
- (b) Heat absorbed
- (c) Change in internal energy

**Key insight:** For isothermal process, $\Delta U = 0$

### Problem 1022: Adiabatic Process
Air ($\gamma = 1.4$) at 300 K and 1 atm is compressed adiabatically to half its volume. Find:
- (a) Final temperature
- (b) Final pressure
- (c) Work required

**Use:** $TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{constant}$

### Problem 1028: Stefan-Boltzmann Law
A blackbody sphere of radius 10 cm is maintained at 1000 K. Calculate:
- (a) Total power radiated
- (b) Wavelength of maximum emission
- (c) Power radiated per unit wavelength at $\lambda_{max}$

**Constants needed:**
- Stefan-Boltzmann: $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$ W/(m²·K⁴)
- Wien's constant: $b = 2.898 \times 10^{-3}$ m·K
