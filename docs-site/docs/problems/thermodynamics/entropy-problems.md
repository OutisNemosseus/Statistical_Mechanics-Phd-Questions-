# Entropy: Problem Set

Problems 1031-1072 cover the second law and entropy.

## Problem Distribution

| Problem Range | Topic | Difficulty |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| 1031-1040 | Carnot cycle | Intermediate |
| 1041-1050 | Heat engines | Advanced |
| 1051-1060 | Entropy calculations | Advanced |
| 1061-1072 | Free expansion & irreversibility | Advanced |

## Sample Problems

### Problem 1031: Carnot Engine
A Carnot engine operates between a hot reservoir at 500 K and a cold reservoir at 300 K.
- (a) Calculate the efficiency
- (b) If the engine produces 1000 W of power, find $Q_H$ and $Q_C$
- (c) What is the entropy change per cycle?

**Solution approach:**
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} = 1 - \frac{300}{500} = 0.4$$

### Problem 1042: Otto Cycle
An ideal Otto cycle has a compression ratio of 8. The air at the start of compression is at 300 K and 100 kPa. If the maximum temperature is 2000 K, find:
- (a) Thermal efficiency
- (b) Mean effective pressure
- (c) Power output for engine speed of 3000 rpm

**Key formula:**
$$\eta_{Otto} = 1 - \frac{1}{r^{\gamma-1}}$$

### Problem 1055: Entropy of Mixing
Two moles of helium at 300 K and 1 atm are mixed with three moles of argon at 300 K and 1 atm. Calculate:
- (a) Entropy change of the system
- (b) Is the process reversible?

**Use:**
$$\Delta S = -nR\sum_i x_i \ln x_i$$

### Problem 1065: Free Expansion
One mole of an ideal gas undergoes free expansion from volume $V$ to $2V$.
- (a) Calculate the entropy change of the gas
- (b) Calculate the entropy change of the surroundings
- (c) Is the process reversible or irreversible?

**Key insight:** Free expansion is irreversible. $\Delta S_{gas} = R\ln 2 > 0$

### Problem 1070: Joule-Thomson Effect
Derive the Joule-Thomson coefficient:
$$\mu_{JT} = \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}\right)_H$$

For a van der Waals gas, show that:
$$\mu_{JT} = \frac{1}{C_P}\left(\frac{2a}{RT} - b\right)$$

## Conceptual Questions

1. Why can't a heat engine have 100% efficiency?
2. What happens to entropy during a reversible adiabatic process?
3. Why does free expansion increase entropy even though no heat is exchanged?
4. How does the Carnot cycle compare to real heat engines?
