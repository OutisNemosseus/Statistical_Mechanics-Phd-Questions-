## Sample Problems

### Problem 1073: Helmholtz Free Energy
For an ideal gas, derive an expression for the Helmholtz free energy $F(T,V)$ in terms of $T$, $V$, and the number of moles $n$.

**Starting point:** $F = U - TS$ where $U = nC_VT$

### Problem 1082: Maxwell Relation Application
Using Maxwell relations, show that for any substance:

$$
\left(\frac{\partial C_V}{\partial V}\right)_T = T\left(\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial T^2}\right)_V
$$

**Hint:** Start with $C_V = T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_V$

### Problem 1088: TdS Equations
Derive the two TdS equations:

$$TdS = C_V dT + T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V dV$$

$$TdS = C_P dT - T\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_P dP$$

### Problem 1095: Clausius-Clapeyron
The vapor pressure of water at 100°C is 1 atm and the latent heat of vaporization is 2260 kJ/kg.

- (a) Estimate the boiling point at 0.5 atm
- (b) At what pressure does water boil at 120°C?
- (c) Calculate the slope $dP/dT$ at 100°C

### Problem 1102: Adiabatic Lapse Rate
Show that the adiabatic lapse rate for dry air is:

$$
\Gamma = -\frac{dT}{dz} = \frac{g}{C_P} \approx 9.8 \text{ K/km}
$$

Where $g$ is gravitational acceleration and $C_P$ is the specific heat of air.

### Problem 1105: Chemical Potential
For an ideal gas mixture, show that the chemical potential of component $i$ is:

$$
\mu_i = \mu_i^0(T) + RT\ln\frac{P_i}{P^0}
$$

where $P_i$ is the partial pressure of component $i$.

## Conceptual Questions

1. When is Gibbs free energy more useful than Helmholtz free energy?
2. What does it mean for a Maxwell relation to be "exact"?
3. Why does the Clausius-Clapeyron equation fail near the critical point?
4. How does chemical potential relate to phase equilibrium?
