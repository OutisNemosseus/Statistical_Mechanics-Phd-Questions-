# Problems Overview

Welcome to the **Statistical Mechanics PhD Problems** collection. This resource contains problems and solutions from the book "Problems and Solutions on Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics" by Yung-Kuo Lim, which compiles qualifying examination problems from major American universities.

## Structure

The problems are organized into two main parts:

### Part I: Thermodynamics (Problems 1001-1105)

| Chapter | Topic | Problems |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Thermodynamic States and the First Law | 1001-1030 |
| 2 | The Second Law and Entropy | 1031-1072 |
| 3 | Thermodynamic Functions and Potentials | 1073-1105 |

### Part II: Statistical Physics (Problems 2001+)

| Chapter | Topic | Problems |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 4 | Maxwell-Boltzmann Statistics | 2001-2050 |
| 5 | Ensemble Theory | 2051-2100 |
| 6 | Quantum Statistics | 2101-2150 |

## PDF Resources

The original problems are available as split PDF files in the repository. See the [PDF Index](./pdf-index) for a complete listing with direct download links.

## How to Use This Resource

1. **Study the theory** - Review the key concepts for each chapter
2. **Attempt problems** - Try solving problems before looking at solutions
3. **Check solutions** - Compare your work with the provided LaTeX solutions
4. **Run code** - Use Python scripts for computational problems
