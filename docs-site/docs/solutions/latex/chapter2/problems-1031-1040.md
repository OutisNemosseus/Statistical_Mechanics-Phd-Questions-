# Problems 1031-1040: Carnot Cycle

Solutions for problems on the Carnot cycle and heat engine efficiency.

## Problem 1031

**Topic:** Basic Carnot Engine

A Carnot engine operates between 500 K (hot) and 300 K (cold).

### Solution

Carnot efficiency:
$$
\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} = 1 - \frac{300}{500} = 0.40 = 40\%
$$

If engine produces 1000 W:
$$
Q_H = \frac{W}{\eta} = \frac{1000}{0.4} = 2500 \text{ W}
$$
$$
Q_C = Q_H - W = 1500 \text{ W}
$$

Entropy change per cycle: $\Delta S_{cycle} = 0$ (reversible)

## Problem 1032

**Topic:** Reversed Carnot Cycle (Heat Pump)

### Key Equations

For heat pump (heating mode):
$$
COP_{HP} = \frac{Q_H}{W} = \frac{T_H}{T_H - T_C}
$$

For refrigerator (cooling mode):
$$
COP_{ref} = \frac{Q_C}{W} = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C}
$$

Relation: $COP_{HP} = COP_{ref} + 1$

## Problem 1033

**Topic:** Carnot Cycle on PV Diagram

### The Four Stages

1. **Isothermal expansion** at $T_H$: $Q_H$ absorbed
2. **Adiabatic expansion**: $T_H \to T_C$
3. **Isothermal compression** at $T_C$: $Q_C$ released
4. **Adiabatic compression**: $T_C \to T_H$

Work done = Area enclosed

## Problem 1034

**Topic:** Cascade Carnot Engines

Two Carnot engines in series.

### Solution

If first engine operates between $T_1$ and $T_2$, second between $T_2$ and $T_3$:

$$
\eta_{total} = 1 - \frac{T_3}{T_1}
$$

The intermediate temperature $T_2$ doesn't affect overall efficiency!

## Problem 1035

**Topic:** Carnot Refrigerator

### Solution Example

Refrigerator maintaining -20°C (253 K) with room at 27°C (300 K):

$$
COP_{max} = \frac{253}{300 - 253} = 5.38
$$

For 100 W cooling power:
$$
W_{min} = \frac{Q_C}{COP} = \frac{100}{5.38} = 18.6 \text{ W}
$$

## Problem 1036

**Topic:** Efficiency Limits

### Why Can't $\eta = 100\%$?

From Kelvin-Planck statement: Cannot convert heat entirely to work.

Mathematical: $\eta = 1 - T_C/T_H$

For $\eta = 1$: need $T_C = 0$ K (impossible) or $T_H = \infty$

## Problem 1037

**Topic:** Non-ideal Heat Engine

### Real Engine Analysis

Real efficiency always less than Carnot:
$$
\eta_{real} < \eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}
$$

Sources of irreversibility:
- Friction
- Heat leakage
- Finite-time processes

## Problem 1038

**Topic:** Carnot Engine with Variable $T_H$

### Solution Approach

For heat source with finite heat capacity:

$$
dQ_H = -C \, dT_H
$$

Integrate efficiency over temperature range.

## Problem 1039

**Topic:** Maximum Work Extraction

### Key Result

From hot reservoir at $T_H$ to environment at $T_C$:

Maximum work extractable:
$$
W_{max} = Q_H\left(1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}\right) = Q_H \cdot \eta_{Carnot}
$$

## Problem 1040

**Topic:** Combined Heat and Power

### Cogeneration Analysis

Total efficiency considering both work and heat output can exceed Carnot efficiency for work alone.
