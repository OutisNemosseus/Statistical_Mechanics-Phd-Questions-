# Problems 1051-1060: Entropy Calculations

Solutions for problems on entropy changes in various processes.

## Problem 1051

**Topic:** Entropy of Ideal Gas

### General Formula

$$
S = nC_V\ln T + nR\ln V + S_0
$$

Or equivalently:
$$
S = nC_P\ln T - nR\ln P + S_0'
$$

## Problem 1052

**Topic:** Entropy Change in Isothermal Process

### Solution

For isothermal expansion of ideal gas:
$$
\Delta S = nR\ln\frac{V_f}{V_i} = -nR\ln\frac{P_f}{P_i}
$$

## Problem 1053

**Topic:** Entropy Change in Heating

### At Constant Volume

$$
\Delta S = nC_V\ln\frac{T_f}{T_i}
$$

### At Constant Pressure

$$
\Delta S = nC_P\ln\frac{T_f}{T_i}
$$

## Problem 1054

**Topic:** Entropy of Phase Transition

### Solution

At constant temperature and pressure:
$$
\Delta S = \frac{\Delta H}{T} = \frac{L}{T}
$$

Example: Melting ice at 273 K
$$
\Delta S = \frac{334 \text{ kJ/kg}}{273 \text{ K}} = 1.22 \text{ kJ/(kg·K)}
$$

## Problem 1055

**Topic:** Entropy of Mixing

### Ideal Gas Mixture

For mixing $n_1$ moles of gas A with $n_2$ moles of gas B at same $T$ and $P$:
$$
\Delta S_{mix} = -R\sum_i n_i\ln x_i = -R(n_1\ln x_1 + n_2\ln x_2)
$$

where $x_i = n_i/(n_1 + n_2)$ is mole fraction.

### Example

Mix 2 mol He with 3 mol Ar:
- $x_{He} = 0.4$, $x_{Ar} = 0.6$
$$
\Delta S = -R(2\ln 0.4 + 3\ln 0.6) = 5.6R = 46.5 \text{ J/K}
$$

## Problem 1056

**Topic:** Gibbs Paradox

### Key Point

For mixing identical gases: $\Delta S = 0$

For mixing different gases: $\Delta S > 0$

Resolution: Indistinguishability of identical particles.

## Problem 1057

**Topic:** Entropy and Irreversibility

### Clausius Inequality

For any process:
$$
\Delta S \geq \frac{Q}{T}
$$

Equality for reversible, inequality for irreversible.

## Problem 1058

**Topic:** Universe Entropy Change

### Heat Transfer Between Bodies

Hot body ($T_H$) transfers heat $Q$ to cold body ($T_C$):
$$
\Delta S_{univ} = \Delta S_H + \Delta S_C = -\frac{Q}{T_H} + \frac{Q}{T_C} = Q\left(\frac{1}{T_C} - \frac{1}{T_H}\right) > 0
$$

## Problem 1059

**Topic:** Entropy of Non-Ideal Gas

### Van der Waals Gas

$$
\Delta S = nC_V\ln\frac{T_f}{T_i} + nR\ln\frac{V_f - nb}{V_i - nb}
$$

---

## Problem 1060

**Topic:** Third Law of Thermodynamics

### Statement

As $T \to 0$: $S \to 0$ for perfect crystals.

### Implications

- Absolute zero is unattainable
- Heat capacities $\to 0$ as $T \to 0$
- Allows calculation of absolute entropies
