# Problems 1011-1020: Ideal Gas Processes

Solutions for problems on ideal gas processes, PV diagrams, and work calculations.

## Problem 1011

**Topic:** Isothermal Expansion

### Key Concepts

For isothermal process ($T = \text{const}$):
- $PV = nRT = \text{const}$
- $\Delta U = 0$ (ideal gas)
- $W = nRT\ln\frac{V_f}{V_i}$
- $Q = W$ (from First Law)

---

## Problem 1012

**Topic:** Isobaric Process

### Key Concepts

For isobaric process ($P = \text{const}$):
- $\frac{V}{T} = \text{const}$
- $W = P\Delta V$
- $Q = nC_P\Delta T$
- $\Delta U = nC_V\Delta T$

---

## Problem 1013

**Topic:** Isochoric Process

### Key Concepts

For isochoric process ($V = \text{const}$):
- $\frac{P}{T} = \text{const}$
- $W = 0$
- $Q = \Delta U = nC_V\Delta T$

---

## Problem 1014

**Topic:** Cyclic Process

### Solution Approach

For any cyclic process:
- $\Delta U_{cycle} = 0$
- $W_{cycle} = Q_{cycle}$
- Net work = area enclosed by PV curve

## Problem 1015

**Topic:** Work Done in Expansion

One mole of ideal gas at 300 K expands isothermally from 10 L to 20 L.

### Solution

$$
W = nRT\ln\frac{V_f}{V_i} = 1 \times 8.314 \times 300 \times \ln 2
$$

$$
\boxed{W = 1729 \text{ J}}
$$

Since isothermal: $Q = W = 1729$ J, $\Delta U = 0$

## Problem 1016

**Topic:** Heat Engine Cycle

### Key Steps

1. Identify each process (isothermal, isobaric, etc.)
2. Calculate $W$, $Q$, $\Delta U$ for each leg
3. Sum to find net work and efficiency

---

## Problem 1017

**Topic:** PV Diagram Analysis

### Solution Method

1. Read initial and final states from diagram
2. Determine process type from path shape
3. Calculate work as area under curve
4. Use First Law for heat and internal energy

## Problem 1018

**Topic:** Adiabatic vs Isothermal Compression

### Comparison

| Property | Isothermal | Adiabatic |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| $Q$ | $\neq 0$ | $= 0$ |
| $\Delta T$ | $= 0$ | $\neq 0$ |
| PV relation | $PV = \text{const}$ | $PV^\gamma = \text{const}$ |
| Final pressure | Lower | Higher |

For same compression ratio, adiabatic process requires more work.

## Problem 1019

**Topic:** Polytropic Process

### Key Equation

For polytropic process: $PV^n = \text{const}$

Work done:
$$
W = \frac{P_1V_1 - P_2V_2}{n-1} = \frac{nR(T_1 - T_2)}{n-1}
$$

Special cases:
- $n = 0$: Isobaric
- $n = 1$: Isothermal
- $n = \gamma$: Adiabatic
- $n = \infty$: Isochoric

---

## Problem 1020

**Topic:** Combined Processes

### Solution Strategy

Break complex processes into simple segments:
1. Identify each segment type
2. Calculate properties for each
3. Use state function properties ($U$, $S$ path-independent)
