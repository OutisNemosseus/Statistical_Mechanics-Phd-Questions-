# Problems 1001-1010: First Law Basics

Solutions for problems on thermodynamic states, temperature measurement, and heat capacity.

## Problem 1001 (Wisconsin)

**Topic:** Temperature Measurement Instruments

Describe briefly the basic principle of the following instruments for making temperature measurements: constant-volume gas thermometer, thermocouple, thermistor.

### Solution

**Constant-volume gas thermometer:** Based on the principle that gas pressure changes with temperature at constant volume. Can approximate an ideal gas thermometer.

**Thermocouple thermometer:** Uses thermoelectric motive force that changes with temperature:
$$
\varepsilon = a + bt + ct^2 + dt^3
$$
Range: $-200°C$ to $1600°C$. Used as standard thermometer from $630.74°C$ to $1064.43°C$.

**Thermistor thermometer:** Measures temperature via metal resistance. Pure platinum thermistors have excellent precision, used as standard from $13.81K$ to $903.89K$.

## Problem 1003 (Wisconsin)

**Topic:** Bimetallic Strip

A bimetallic strip of total thickness $x$ is straight at temperature $T$. What is the radius of curvature $R$ when heated to $T + \Delta T$? The coefficients of linear expansion are $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ with $\alpha_2 > \alpha_1$.

### Solution

After heating, the mid-line lengths become:
$$
l_1 = l_0(1 + \alpha_1 \Delta T), \quad l_2 = l_0(1 + \alpha_2 \Delta T)
$$

From geometry:
$$
l_2 - l_1 = \frac{x}{2}\theta
$$

And:
$$
l_1 + l_2 = 2R\theta
$$

Solving these equations:

$$
\boxed{R = \frac{x}{(\alpha_2 - \alpha_1)\Delta T}}
$$

## Problem 1004 (Wisconsin)

**Topic:** Free Expansion

An ideal gas confined to volume $V_1$ in an insulated container of volume $V_1 + V_2$. The remainder is evacuated. The partition is removed. What is the final temperature?

### Solution

This is adiabatic free expansion of an ideal gas:
- No work done ($W = 0$, expansion into vacuum)
- No heat exchanged ($Q = 0$, insulated)
- Therefore $\Delta U = 0$

For an ideal gas, internal energy depends only on temperature:
$$
U = U(T) \implies \Delta T = 0
$$

**Final temperature:** $\boxed{T}$ (unchanged)

## Problem 1005 (Columbia)

**Topic:** Free Expansion Through Small Hole

Similar to Problem 1004 - an insulated chamber divided into two halves, with gas on one side and vacuum on the other.

### Solution

Same analysis as Problem 1004. The equilibrium temperature is $\boxed{T_0}$ (unchanged).

## Problem 1006 (UC Berkeley)

**Topic:** Heat Capacity of Copper Penny

Define heat capacity $C_V$ and calculate the numerical value for a copper penny.

### Solution

Heat capacity at constant volume:
$$
C_V = \left(\frac{dQ}{dT}\right)_V
$$

**Dulong-Petit Law:** For solids, $C_V \approx 3R$ per mole.

A copper penny:
- Mass: ~32 g
- Atomic mass of Cu: 64 g/mol
- Number of moles: $n = 0.5$ mol

$$
C_V = n \cdot 3R = 0.5 \times 3 \times 8.314 = 12.5 \text{ J/K}
$$

Converting to calories:
$$
\boxed{C_V \approx 3 \text{ cal/°C}}
$$

## Problem 1007

**Topic:** Heat Capacity Derivation

[Solution available in LaTeX source file]

## Problem 1008

**Topic:** Clement-Desormes Method

Method for measuring $\gamma = C_P/C_V$ for gases.

### Key Equations

For adiabatic process: $PV^\gamma = \text{const}$

The Clement-Desormes method uses:
$$
\gamma = \frac{h_1}{h_1 - h_3}
$$

where $h_1$ and $h_3$ are manometer heights before release and after thermal equilibrium.
